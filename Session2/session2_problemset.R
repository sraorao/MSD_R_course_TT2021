#### Problem set ####
# Use the migmorph data.frame for these questions

# Q1: Knockdown of which gene results in the highest migration?
# # hint: this can be accomplished with the max() function

# Q2: Make a new data.frame that has only rows with 0.9 > migration > 0.4 AND elongatedness > 1.4
# Q2.1: What is the correlation between migration and elongatedness in this new dataset?
# Q2.2: Draw an XY plot showing the relationship between these two variables in this new dataset
