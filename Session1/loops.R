###Testing the truth value of an expression####
1 < 2
34 > 35
1 <= (2/2)
1 >= (2/2)
"A" == "B"
"TP53" == toupper("tp53")
tolower("TP53")
"A" %in% LETTERS

4 %% 3

x <- "c"
x > 1000
y <- "i"
x > y
z <- "A"
x> z

##Logical operators
x <- c(TRUE, 4, 7, FALSE)
y <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
! x
x & y
x && y
x | y
x || y

###CONDITIONALS####
##IF conditional
x <- 4
if(x > 0) {
  print("Positive number")
}
x <- -4

goi_name = "PTEN"
if(goi_name %in% gene_names) {
  print("The gene of interest is in the gene set")
}

##IF ELSE
x <- 4
if(x > 0) {
  print("Positive number")
} else {
  print("Not positive number")
}
x <- -4

##chained conditionals
x <- 0
if (x < 0) {
  print("Negative number")
} else if (x > 0) {
  print("Positive number")
} else {
  print("Zero")
}

#Q: write a conditional for printing "The gene of interest is in the gene set"
#or "The gene of interest is not in the gene set"
#use different genes - RB1, AGO2

###LOOPS####
##WHILE loop performs an action as long as a condition is true
i <- 1
while (i < 6) {
  print(i)
  i = i+1
}

am_i_happy_today = TRUE
while(am_i_happy_today) {  # an infinite loop
  print("happy")
}

while(am_i_happy_today) {  # a loop that runs only once
  print("happy")
  am_i_happy_today = FALSE
}

counter = 1
while(counter <= 20) {
  print(counter)
  counter = counter + 1
}

index = 1
while(index < 27) {
  new_text = paste("letter", index, "is", LETTERS[index])
  print(new_text)
  index = index + 1
}

##FOR loop iterates over a vector or a list
# perform an action over every item

for (year in c(2011,2012,2013,2014,2015,2016)) 
{	
  print(paste("The year is", year))
}	

gene_names = c("TP53", "PTEN", "RB1", "MYC")
for(each_item in gene_names) {
  each_item_lcase = tolower(each_item)
  print(each_item_lcase)
}

#Q: write a loop for printing the name and the counter for each gene in the vector gene_names


####Problem set####

#Q: In the vector gene_names, print the genes whose names start with P, using a loop to iterate through each gene name
    # hint: Use the startsWith() function
    # Advanced hint: You don't actually need a loop for this, as startsWith() is a vectorised function! (look up https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/vectorized-operations.html)

#Q: In a vector of numbers 1 to 20, print the numbers that are divisible by 3
    # hint: Create a vector with the c() function or using the : operator
    # hint: Use a loop to iterate through each element of the vector
    # hint: Use if() and %% to check if the remainder is 0
    # Advanced hint: %% is vectorised too, so again, there's no need for a loop here!
