####Problem set####

#Q: In the vector gene_names, print the genes whose names start with P, using a loop to iterate through each gene name
# hint: Use the startsWith() function
# Advanced hint: You don't actually need a loop for this, as startsWith() is a vectorised function! (look up https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/rprogdatascience/vectorized-operations.html)

#Q: In a vector of numbers 1 to 20, print the numbers that are divisible by 3
# hint: Create a vector with the c() function or using the : operator
# hint: Use a loop to iterate through each element of the vector
# hint: Use if() and %% to check if the remainder is 0
# Advanced hint: %% is vectorised too, so again, there's no need for a loop here!
