# MISSING DATA - are there any missing data? Do you want to remove/replace them? ####
# No for this dataset, because it's a very clean one already

# Q: Create a new column in the dataset where the value should be "low" or "high" 
# depending on whether the population is lower or higher than the median population respectively

# We first need to calculate the median population; this can be done using base R or
# using dplyr, either method is fine. We store this value in the variable median_population
