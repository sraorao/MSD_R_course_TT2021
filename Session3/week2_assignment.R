# Q1. Install the stemHypoxia data package from Bioconductor by following the 
#     instructions here: https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/experiment/html/stemHypoxia.html

 

# Q2. Load the stemHypoxia gene expression data.frame and draw a boxplot of gene expressions for all samples
#     hint: find the help page for the dataset to get you started. BUT, there is an error 
#           in the example code, how can you fix it?

 

# Q3. Make a new column in the gene expression data.frame for the mean expression of each gene across
#     all the samples. Sort the data.frame from highest to lowest mean expression and subset the top
#     10 genes (with the highest mean expression).
#     hint: Useful functions for this task are rowMeans(), base::order()/dplyr::arrange()
